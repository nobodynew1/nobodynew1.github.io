	<b>Day one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell"><u id="Hell" class="link">Compsci</u></a></b>: So far I have learned a couple things about coding, such as how to format websites, and how to navigate around css. Right now I am trying to see what projects would intrest me, and if there is anything that I would like to work on. I am excited to see how I grow in coding through out the rest of the year, and I am excited to learn about new mechanics. However, I do get a bit frustrated when some of my code doesn't work as expected, or how a single word/mistake could change everything. As for my plans for the next week, I hope to continue developing my website, and find new ways in which I can improve.

<div></div>
<div id="journal_entry2"><b>Day one in October 8th</b>: After spending hours looking up things, I finally made it so that a sound file plays after clicking on the goldfish. However, I'm not gonna tell <b>anyone</b>. The only way they will find out my secret is if they accidently click on the goldfish, or read this Journal entry. I do feel really proud of my self though, because the amount of time I spent looking up how to do this one small thing is insane. You wouldn't believe how many results on google are absolutely useless.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="journal_entry3"><b>October 25th</b>: I have finally made my first animation, and after debating for around 2.5 seconds, I have decided to add it to my projects page. I think that it is pretty creative, so I hope whoever is reading this thinks that it is cool. I have labeled it as the dino project, and you will see the reasoning behind that title if you have not already seen the animation.</div>

<div id="journal_entry4"><b>November 10th</b>: They want us to do a journal entry about our steps we take when debugging but im lazy so i havent done it yet.</div>

<div id="journal_entry5"><b>November 12th</b>: The math teacher let me have fun during class because I finished earlier, so time to write another journal entry. So for my steps for debugging, first I will check my source material to see if I copied their code properly. If not I will fix the error. On the off chance that I somehow made the code myself (implying that I'm not failing this class), I will open the console to check for errors. If the console proves useless, which it probably will, I will then check my code to see if I have any style errors, or have some of my variables outside of the function. If my code still doesn't work, I see seek out peer advice.</div>

<div id="journal_entry6"><b>November 14th</b>: I realized that I havent done my present project yet so I might to it today. I was orignally gonna make something for my history teacher but then I realized that what I had in mind is going to take a lot of effort, so I'm probably going to do something more simple.</div>

<div id="journal_entry7"><b>Jan 11th</b>: So they wanted us to watch some recap videos for 45 minutes or something so I did that, and afterwards make an emoji generator. But I didnt want to make some <i>lame</i> emoji generator so I decided to find some custom ones. Here is <a href="emoji.html" class="link">the link</a> to that if you want to see it, just press almost any button on the keyboard and it will work.

<div id="journal_entry8"><b>Age of Minecraft</b>: As of last week, not only have I received permission to (sometimes) skip class, but I also am able to do coding projects using Minecraft blocks as a medium. I will now be posting updates onto what command block projects I have created thus far. Below will be a couple videos of what I created using these command blocks, and I will summarize what I've made. <br> <br> <br>

	<a class="firstvidtext"><b> #1) The Guardian Helmet</b>: This Helmet makes it so that after you reach a certain amount of hp, it will spawn three Iron Golems to protect you. Of course, like every balanced item, this abiltiy has a cooldown, and these Iron Golems will despawn after some time. You will get a message when the abiltiy goes off cooldown. <br> <br></a>

	<a class="firstvidtext"><b> #2) The Beserker Boots</b>: Similar to the helmet, the boots also activate on low hp. However, instead of spawning Iron Golems, these boots give you simple potion effects such as strength, speed, regeneration, and jumpboost. It's cooldown is the same as the helmet, and of course the effect is temporary. You will get a message when the ability goes off cooldown. <br> </a>

</video>
</center> <br> <br>
	<a class="firstvidtext"><b> #3) The Anti-Grav Bow</b>: This bow shoots arrows that are not affected by gravity. When these arrows hit a surface, a timer will start before they explode. Rather than doing damage, this explosion will make nearby entities levitate for a short duration. <b> Having the bow in your inventory makes you immune to this effect.</b><br></a>
<center><video width="640" height="480" controls>
  <source src="Bow1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center> <br> <br>
	<a class="firstvidtext"><b> #4) Test Charm</b>: While in your off hand, this charm will place barrier blocks under you, essentially allowing you to fly. These barrier blocks are removed when you step off of them, or unequip the charm. For conveniency, looking up and down while holding this charm will allow you to ascend and descend respectively. <br> </a>

  <source src="Testcharm.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center> <br> <br>
	<center><b>Due to how these command blocks work, you can only get these items through commands (For example, giving yourself a bow, and naming it Anti-Grav Bow in an anvil will not trigger the effects).</b></center>
