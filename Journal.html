	<b>Day one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell"><u class="link">Hell</u></a></b>: So far I have learned absolutly nothing. There is no food here, and I am starving for every minute of the day. I feel sick, and the ignorance of everyone here disgusts me to the core. They have no idea what the true nature of this place is, and wont be expecting the upcoming war. I feel sicker as every day passes by, and the medicine here is close to none. Right now I am looking for a way to get out, and I seem to have found hope within a man named 'Charles Foster Stewert'. He seems to run the so called schedule around here. Luckily for me, the inside connections I've built up within the first couple of weeks are able to keep this plan as a viable option. 'What are you excited about or frustrated by', you asked? Ha. You think that in a world where buildings are burnt to ashes, and all signs of life are in flames, that there would be anything to be excited about? As for frustration, alot of the plans that I start to set up are stopped before they can even be executed. It seems to be the work of some higher power, with a will of it's own. They force us to abide by a specific language, and I have started to dig deeper into the mechanics behind it. They call this topic '<i>coding'</i>. As for my plans for the next week, I hope to start an organization. We will be the leader of the rebellion, and will go by the name '<i>Salvation'</i>.
